# Tensorflow NeuroEvolution BTC Trader
Tensorflow is used to build a population of models that breed and mutate iteratively. The initial population is built given a specified network topology and assigned random weights. For each generation, these weights are randomly mutated and each network is assigned a fitness value based on their performance. A pooling algorithm is used to select models for the next generation and the process is repeated. Models with a higher fitness tend to make it to the next generation where their weights are mutated and idealy create a higher performing generation
